Hi, I am Ziqi Guo, a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue university, co-advised by Prof. [Xiulin Ruan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/NANOENERGY/) and Prof. [Guang Lin](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~lin491/).

Prior to Purdue, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science & Technology in 2021. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of physics simulation, energy transport and machine learning. I am deeply interested in AI for science study by designing powerful data-driven models to accelerate physical simulations and explore inverse design solutions. By applying AI techniques to a diverse range of scientific domains ranging from thermal and nanophotonic simulations to atomic-scale modeling, I aim to unlock new insights and accelerate scientific discovery.


 <!-- By combining AI with various physical simulations like finite element, Monte Carlo, and first-principles methods, I aim to unlock new insights and accelerate scientific discovery. -->


<!-- I am currently using multiscale, multiphysics simulation and AI approaches to investigate the thermal and optical properties of materials, which is useful in many applications including thermal management and radiative cooling. -->

<!-- Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://ZiqiGuo98.github.io/files/ZiqiGuo_CV.pdf).  -->
