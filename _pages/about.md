Hi, I am Ziqi Guo, a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue university, advised by Prof. [Xiulin Ruan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/NANOENERGY/).

Prior to Purdue, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science & Technology in 2021. 

My research interest lies in the intersection of atomic simulation, energy transport and machine learning. I am currently using multiscale, multiphysics simulation and AI approaches to investigate the thermal and optical properties of materials, which is useful in many applications including thermal management and radiative cooling.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://ZiqiGuo98.github.io/files/ZiqiGuo_CV.pdf).
