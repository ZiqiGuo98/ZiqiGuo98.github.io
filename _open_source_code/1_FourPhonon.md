FourPhonon: An extension module to ShengBTE for computing four-phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity

The calculation of phonon scattering, which is critical for understanding thermal properties, is notably computationally intensive. This complexity poses a significant challenge for the high-throughput screening of materials' thermal characteristics. To address this issue, we have developed two innovative approaches leveraging [machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01020-9) and [statistical sampling method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01215-8). These methods have achieved significant acceleration, improving computational efficiency by orders of magnitude.

The sampling method is integrated as an option to the FourPhonon code. [Access the open source code here](https://github.com/FourPhonon/FourPhonon)
