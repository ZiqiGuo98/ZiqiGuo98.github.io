FourPhonon: An extension module to ShengBTE for computing four-phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity

An accelerated phonon scattering calculation is integrated as an option to the FourPhonon code. It reduces the computational cost of predicting thermal and MIR-optical properties by up to 99% with relative errors less than 10% by using maximum likelihood approximation to estimate phonon scattering rate.

The updated version of FourPhonon will be publish soon.
