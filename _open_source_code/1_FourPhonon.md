FourPhonon: An extension module to ShengBTE for computing four-phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity

An sampling-accelerated phonon scattering calculation is integrated as an option to the FourPhonon code. It accelerates the first-principles prediction of thermal conductivity and radiative properties by over 10<sup>4</sup> times.
