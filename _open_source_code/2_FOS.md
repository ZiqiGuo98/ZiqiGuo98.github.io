Fast Optical Spectrum (FOS) calculations for nanoparticle media by combining Mie theory with Monte Carlo simulations.


FOS, which means "light" in Greek, is used for Fast Optical Spectrum (FOS) calculations for nanoparticle media by combining Mie theory with either Monte Carlo simulations or a pre-trained deep neural network. It is particularly useful for understanding the performance of radiative cooling material.
