* Reduced the computational cost of predicting  thermal and MIR-optical properties by up to 99\% with relative errors less than 10\% by using the maximum likelihood approximation to estimate phonon scattering rate.

* Integrated the accelerated phonon scattering calculation as an option of the open source code [FourPhonon](https://github.com/FourPhonon/FourPhonon)
