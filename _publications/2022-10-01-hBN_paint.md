* Ultrawhite cooling paint is created incorporating hBN nanoplatelets and nanopores

* High solar reflectance of 97.9% is achieved with 150-μm thin and lightweight layer

* Full daytime cooling under direct sunlight with 5°–6°C below ambient on average

* Simulations reveal high scattering coefficient and strong backscattering
